		<h2>Inside Out</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">Inside Out is American computer-animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.Within the mind of a girl named Riley are the basic emotions that control her actionsâ€”Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Her experiences become memories, stored as colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important "core memories" power aspects of her personality which take the form of floating islands. Joy acts as the leader, and she and the rest of the emotions try to limit Sadness's influence.</p>
